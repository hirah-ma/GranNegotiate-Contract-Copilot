## Problem Statement

Contract negotiation is often a slow, manual, and complex process that involves interpreting lengthy documents, understanding legal terminology, and making decisions about terms that can impact a company's operations. Traditional methods are time-consuming, prone to human error, and require significant expertise. GranNegotiate aims to automate the analysis and negotiation process by helping businesses efficiently review and negotiate contracts with the help of AI.

## Solution

GranNegotiate is a web-based application that streamlines the contract negotiation process. By leveraging IBM Granite and Granite Guardian models, our solution automatically analyzes contract clauses, highlights potential issues, and provides actionable insights for negotiation. Users can either upload a contract or use a sample contract, and the tool will provide suggestions for improvements based on the analysis.

## Features

- **Contract Upload**: Upload PDFs or DOCX files.  
- **Sample Contract**: Quick start with a pre-loaded sample contract.  
- **Clause-Level Analysis**: Breaks down the contract into smaller chunks for easier analysis.  
- **Negotiation Suggestions**: Provides actionable recommendations for improving contract terms.  
- **Compliance Check**: Identifies any missing or non-compliant clauses.  
- **Safer Contracts**: Generates a safer, improved version of the contract for the user.

---

## IBM Granite Models Used

- **Granite-3-3-8b-Instruct**: Used for clause-level analysis of the uploaded contract, to understand the contract's language and context, identify risks, and highlight key clauses.  
- **Granite Guardian**: Performs a safety check on the contract, flagging any potentially harmful or abusive language and ensuring compliance with ethical and legal standards.

## Architecture

**Frontend:**
- Built with Streamlit to provide a simple, intuitive, and interactive user interface.

**Backend:**
- LangChain for splitting and chunking large contracts into manageable sections.

- Granite Guardian for safety and compliance checks.

**Workflow:**
1. The user uploads a contract or uses a sample contract.
2. The contract is split into smaller chunks for analysis.
